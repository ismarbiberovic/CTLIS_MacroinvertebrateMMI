# CTLIS_MacroinvertebrateMMI
Macroinvertebrate development for the Long Island Sound region with CT DEEP and NEIWPCC. 

This repository supports the development and application of the Connecticut Long Island Sound (CTLIS) Macroinvertebrate Multimetric Index (MMI), a tool designed to assess the ecological condition of embayment sites using benthic macroinvertebrate communities.

Developed by Tetra Tech in collaboration with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) and NEIWPCC, the CTLIS MMI integrates biological, chemical, and physical data from over 200 sites sampled between 2010 and 2021. The final index model includes six metrics that reflect key ecological responses to stress, such as pollution tolerance, bioturbation potential, and the presence of sensitive taxa.
